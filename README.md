# 🌪️ Cyclone Damage Assessment on the Sundarbans Mangrove Ecosystem

This project analyzes the impacts of five major cyclones—Fani, Amphan, Bulbul, Yaas, and Sitrang—on the Sundarbans mangrove forest (2019–2022), using remote sensing techniques and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery processed in Google Earth Engine.

## 📌 Highlights

- Uses NDVI, NDMI, and NBR vegetation indices
- Classification of damage into **moderate** and **severe**
- Area-wise damage calculation
- Temporal comparative analysis across five cyclones
- Spatial insights into damage patterns (edge vs. interior, recovery trends)

## 🛰️ Tools & Data

- **Platform**: Google Earth Engine
- **Satellite**: Sentinel-2
- **Languages**: JavaScript (GEE), LaTeX (report)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/` – GEE scripts and analysis code
- `report/` – Full LaTeX project and compiled PDF
- `results/` – Output maps and summary tables
- `data/` – (Optional) Sample or processed data for reference
